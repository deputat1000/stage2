# Unit Testing Framework
```
1. Create a 'calculator' class with the following methods:
    * add - this method must sum the parameters passed to it and return the sum as the result
    * multiply - this method should multiply the parameters passed to it and return the multiplication as the result
2. Create unit tests which check that the calculator methods work correctly
